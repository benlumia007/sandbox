# Contributing
The project is handled via its GitHub Repository, you can open tickets, create patches, and send pull requests.

## Pull Request
I normally don't do pull request since the project itself just works and normally I don't do updates unless I find something broken. If you insist on doing some kind of pull request, the best is to find the problem and a solution second. 

Please don't make any pull requests on any branches especially `master`. If you do find anything that needs patches, you then will need to create a new branch, patch it, and update the `changelog.md` so that any patches or features can be safely notify.
