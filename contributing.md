# Contributing
The project is handled via its GitHub Repository, you can open tickets, create patches, and send pull requests.

## Pull Request
I normally don't do pull request since the project itself just works and normally I don't do updates unless I find something broken. If you insist on doing some kind of pull request, the best is to find the problem and a solution second.
